        <p style="color :goldenrod;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 20px;">Bruce Lee[b] (born Lee Jun-fan;[c] November 27, 1940 â€“ July 20, 1973) was a Hong Kong-American martial artist and actor. He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is sometimes credited with paving the way for the combat sport mixed martial arts (MMA).[3] Lee is considered by some commentators and martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged the gap between East and West. He is credited with promoting Hong Kong action cinema and helping to change the way Chinese people were presented in American films.[4]</p>
